conference: DevFest Atlanta
location: Atlanta, GA, USA
abstract: State Management with Angular Signals is a cutting-edge topic that delves into the innovative features of Angular's latest updates. This talk will explore the introduction of Signals in Angular, a new reactive primitive that offers a more granular approach to tracking and updating application state. The discussion would cover the evolution from traditional BehaviorSubjects to Signals, highlighting the benefits of reduced boilerplate, improved performance, and a more intuitive API for developers. Attendees will learn how to implement Signals to manage state efficiently, with practical examples demonstrating the setup of a Signals-based service to store and update state across multiple components. The talk will also look at 3rd party options, such as NGRX Signal-Store. By the end of the session, developers will have a comprehensive understanding of Angular Signals and how to leverage them for more efficient and maintainable state management in their Angular applications.
