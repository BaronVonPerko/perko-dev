conference: Connect.Tech 2024
location: Atlanta, GA, USA
abstract: SignalStore, a feature of NgRx, offers a declarative approach to managing application state, leveraging the power of Signals for a clear and maintainable codebase. It simplifies state management by allowing developers to define stores with a combination of features that can include state properties, computed signals, and methods. This talk will cover the basics of creating a SignalStore, and practical examples of how to integrate it into Angular projects for efficient state management. We will also explore the benefits of its lightweight architecture, which does not rely on RxJS, and how it can be extended with custom features to fit the unique needs of an application.
