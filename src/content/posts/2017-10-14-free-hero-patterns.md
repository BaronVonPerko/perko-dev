I was listening to [Full Stack Radio](http://www.fullstackradio.com/) the other day, and the hosts were talking about how to be a better designer.  One tool that they recommended was [Hero Patterns](http://www.heropatterns.com/), a tool that generates free hero patterns for your website.  The service has tons of SVG based patterns that you can use on your website, and you can even tweak the opacity and colors to match your current design.

I added a couple of patterns to the landing page of eListings, and I think it made a big difference.  Here is an example of an area that used to just have a plain white background:

It is a subtle change, but I think it really makes this section of the page look a lot better.  I highly suggest checking out the site, as it is completely free and super easy to use.  I plan to use their service again on my future projects.
