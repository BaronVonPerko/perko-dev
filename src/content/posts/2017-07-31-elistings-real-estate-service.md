This weekend I launched the landing page for a new real estate service.  The product itself is scheduled to launch in September, but I wanted to post a little bit about it here.

![eListings Example](/assets/images/elistings-responsive.png)

eListings is a simple site that allows real estate agents to create beautiful websites for their listings. There are other services that do this, but the sites are not always responsive, and usually require a lot of information before getting a site up.  Not to mention, these services can cost over $25 per month!

I wanted to build something that would take only a couple of minutes for an agent to build a site, and to easily share it with social media.  eListings allows a user to enter in basic information about the property, such as address, bedrooms, bathrooms, and a few other fields.  Uploading photos is a snap, just drag and drop all of the photos of the property, and the album is created.

If you're an agent and want to receive updates on the product and to know when the site is ready for you to use, head over to eListings and give us your email address.

Now for some techy stuff; I am building the service on Laravel 5.4 and mySQL, and have it hosted on a DigitalOcean server and am utilizing the Laravel Forge service to make my sys admin work easier.  The images are being hosted on a Google Cloud server, which is very reasonably priced and easy to use.
